1. Configure serverless MB-52406

Regular install: # Create the directory (if it doesn’t exist): sudo mkdir -p /etc/couchbase.d

You will likely have to change the permissions of the directory/file: sudo chmod ugo+r /etc/couchbase.d/config_profile and obviously give whatever user is gonna write “serverless” to the file in the next step “write” permissions or use sudo.
Place the text “serverless” (without quotes) into a file in that directory called config_profile (/etc/couchbase.d/config_profile).
Install couchbase-server and run it or if it’s already installed and running, restarting should be enough to switch into serverless mode, but I would warn against doing it on anything but a completely fresh, uninitialized, node. You will run into problems if you are attempting to just flip back and fourth between profiles and you have initialized the server.
Cluster_run: # This method is easier..All methods above, also work for cluster_run, OR..

Just pass in --serverless to cluster_run when starting the product.
For running in default mode, it is not required to do anything, however you can also change it to “default” by placing that text into the file /etc/couchbase.d/config_profile or the environment variable CB_FORCE_PROFILE="default" but these are not actually required.
