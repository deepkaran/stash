raw_data_size - data size of actual index keys (excluding storage data structures overhead)
data_size - uncompressed data size (compression_ratio * data_size_on_disk)
disk_size is the total disk space taken up by the index(including index data files, checkpoints etc) [compressed]
log_space_on_disk is only the index data files(including garbage) [compressed]
data_size_on_disk is the valid data (excluding garbage) [compressed]

fragmentation = ((log_space_on_disk - data_size_on_disk)/log_space_on_disk)

From John:

data size is the total data in plasma regardless it is currently on disk or resident in memory.   It includes old records due to MVCC.
raw_data_size does not include old records due to MVCC
data_size_on_disk is the actual number of bytes stored on disk (compressed)
