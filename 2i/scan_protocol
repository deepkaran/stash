1. sec key is stored in the storage in collatejson encoded format
2. scan_pipeline - IndexScanDecoder::Routine calls piSplitEntry to convert from collatejson to json marshalled format([]byte)
3. scan_pipeline - IndexScanWriter::Routine calls d.w.Row(pk, sk) 
4. scan_protocol - protoResponseWrite::Row makes a COPY of these keys(copying into the rowBuf) and then marshalls into protobuf(when rowBuf is full).
