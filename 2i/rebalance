Important cases:

- Move Index from A to B and failover B when movement is in progress. Now recover B and rebalance in. [The TT needs special cleanup. Rebalance would fail on recovery if index data in large.]
- Move Index from A to B and failover B when movement is in progress. Now rebalance out and rebalance in. [Will trigger orphan token logic]
- Move Index from A to B and failover A when movement is in progress. Now recover A and rebalance in.
