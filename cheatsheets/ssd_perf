Today I had a discussion with Siri regarding memdb persistence writer sharding and tried out a test to see if SSD parallel channels would be utilized in case of single sequential writer.
Reading up a bit on SSDs, learned if write payload is >= SSD cluster size, no matter random or sequential IO, SSDs will be able to deliver maximum throughput
Internally io scheduler will make use of all parallel channels
Most SSDs will have either 16MB or 32MB cluster block sizes
So, it looks like setting 32MB buffer size as default for memdb persistent writer would be enough to make use of SSD with single writer.
