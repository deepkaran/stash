Did you try to ping, from the query receiving node (merger), the other nodes and see what times you get? From the merger node, you also run 'time nc -vvv -z othernodeip 8092'), or use hping3 to measure TCP connection/response timings.

This effectively shows there's network with congestion, slow nodes (perhaps under heavy swap, use atop or dstat to check) or connectivity problems.
