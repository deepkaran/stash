sudo ngrep -W byline -d lo0 port 8094


"sudo /usr/sbin/tcpdump -w /var/tmp/capture.out port 8091 or port 11210 or port 8092"

netstat -tnp | grep TIME_WAIT | wc -l

watch -n1 "netstat -tnp | grep TIME_WAIT | wc -l"

The tool I used is “Network Link Conditioner” - https://nshipster.com/network-link-conditioner/
Once I created the remote cluster references and replications successfully, I set the network link to 100% loss.
This will also trigger the same “i/o timeout” error seen in the cbcollect logs.
